These are some custom scripts that I wrote for myself.  I have multiple machines,
so I figure I ought to sync them.  I love git: hence, I'm using git to track `em.

I am putting this in ~/.local/custBin, and adding it to my path: that way, these
remain my custom scripts, and not whatever is installed to my user.

I further reccomend setting up a file in ~/.bash_completion to run the contents of
./bash_completions, as those are quite nice IMHO.  My example is included here,
as .bash_completion-EXAMPLE


Obviously, YOU are responsible for any damage these do: and yes, that also applies
to future versions of myself.
